# LayaAir engine Quick Start Guide (recommended for beginner)



​     The biggest problem for many novice developers is to learn ideas. Faced with a new technology, if you do not know how to start, road will be complex. This article provides some advice learning, reference andsuggestions to go  further more. confirmed developers can skip this article, and directly view the official website engine examples with API.

 

## Step 1: select development language

LayaAir engine supports officially ActionScript3 (AS3), TypeScript (TS) and JavaScript (JS), which language is better to use? It can be confusing at beginning, each language have own specific structure that you may feel conveniant or not.  At last,  the engine's API performance are exactly the same.

However, if you plan to lead more large project and ensure efficience maintenance, we recommand you ActionScript 3, Why ? With advanced OOP structure, multi collaboration and architecture code management, you will have suitable development of large-scale game project. Although JS language may easier to access, maintenance can be risky. But you can say TS also have an advanced OOP syntax, what the advantages compare AS3 ?

Originally , LayaAir engine architecture was based on AS3 development.  The release version in JS is generated through transcompiler "LayaCompiler". However it will not affect the logic of the code, and debug case in release mode is still readable and clear. Any troubleshooting in your big project should be easier to solve than if it was coded in natif JS. For the TS case, it use also transcompilation, but we cant warranty the same confrontation for bug issues as AS3.

If you have special preference instead of AS, it is not problem. Each developer can choose any language development supported by the LayaAir engine, API functionality and architecture is same for each one.

 

 

## Step 2: prepare the development environment

TS and JS developers are recommanded to use LayaAir IDE because it is ergonomic, and facilitate coding with debugging, UI editing, timeline and particle editor, and many useful tools. For the AS3 ones, we recommand to use the well known FlashDevelop or Flash Builder. Flash Builder is more powerful in terms of syntax, error correction, and support MAC Apple systems, but the tool installation packages are very large. FlashDevelop is prefered if you looking for lightweight ones. 

Since the product to the project code will compile to JS code, the development of TS or AS3 need to configure the environment, so it need some extra settings for the release.





## Step 3: Write your first "Hello Layabox" with LayaAir

Learning procedures to write "Hello world" has become an international practice. LayaAir engine learning is no exception. When you see the first LayaAir engine program "Hello Layabox" displayed, it will show that your development environment successfully configured.



 

## Step 4: overcome entire LayaAir sample

​    After completing the text display of the "Hello Layabox", we need to get to know the other API functionalities. We recommended for newcomers to learn from official website developer center, practise and study from the LayaAir engine online examples. Depending the project you plan to develop, each example can save your learning time. At least let you know which functionalities are available and proper way to implement it. After full experience, you'll have a basic understanding of the LayaAir engine's API, and you'll be able to figure out when developing the game.

Additional hints, in the code area of the engine example, the JavaScript version provides online editing and execution functions. You can manipulate directly from your browser. All source code project can be grab on GitHub.

 



## Step 5: Learn the toolchain of LayaAir engine

After experienced and study the engine examples and the API, you can already use the code tools to directly develop the game function. However, for complex games, it is necessary for developers to sharpen their tools and learn some visual development tools, which is the only way to greatly improve development efficiency. LayaAirIDE as a visual integrated development environment, in addition to coding, but also includes UI editing, animation editing, particle editing, scene editing and other functions, is the first to recommend you.

 Layabox's official website has listed the support of some mainstream 3rd party tools for the LayaAir engine. It makes a powerful tool chain, allowing developers to use a lot of possibilities, efficient  and no limited for development of various types of games. We will not  introduced them one by one, but mainly are Spine for skeletal animation editor Spine, TiledMap for map editor, and third is editor Unity3D.

 



## Step 6: learning project debugging

Debugging project itself is not a very difficult point, but some developers have just come into contact with HTML5 often ask  about debugging. In the LayaAir technical documentation "2D Advanced" will focus on debugging instruction and the publishing environment.

 



## Step 7: learn and memorize performance optimization tips

At present, the hardware performance of mobile devices is far less than that PC hardware.  Then engine performance optimization will be a very important factor. It can occurs limitation benchmark problems if you have ambitious implementation.

If the engine performance is not good, optimize the project will not effect too much and can not break through this ceiling. If your aim is also to run on mobile devices, learns the engine basics to avoid performance optimization method and memorize by heart.



 

 

## Step 8: use small game to confirm acquiered knowledge

After following the steps above and practical document, you can be used it in your own multimedia content project to verify the results of your study . For short-term project, withoput  R & D experience of developers, we recommended to use small games. 

Small game demo are also teached on Tencent classroom video courses.





## Step 9: Study the generic and modular programming

During your development, you may encounter some slow down compilation problem in your large project. Because a lot of code and code files are involved, it is inevitable to affect compilation time. This is not only a problem faced on HTML5 large projects, but also any technologies. Most of the developers who have major experience in game projects will use a modular collaborative development approach.



 



## Step 10: How to get the official technical Q & A and guidance

During your practise case development, you may face some difficulty to involve with the engine, so how you can get a fast answer ? We dont recommand to use directly on live QQ group. We advice you to check whether your questions have been asked previously by others developers in Q&A community (ask.layabox.com). If you don't have a similar problem, you can create questions in the community and describe the issues in detail. The more detailed the code, screenshots, or any informations will be efficience to find the right issues. The official technical support staff always prioritize issues in the community, and ensure that each question will be answered. 

For questions that have been answered but need to be followed continuously, developers can take the initiative to follow up, and highlight the administrator by @.

In the course of learning, if you have high-speed network conditions, but also suggest that you view video tutorials, the whole follow the operation, will be more intuitive and easy to understand. The video tutorials are divided into two categories: free viewing and paid one. Free tutorials can be directly in the Youku Video (type "LayaAir" in search). Paid one can go to the classroom teaching of Tencent (layabox.ke.qq.com), with no ads content and clear explain done by experimented developers.
