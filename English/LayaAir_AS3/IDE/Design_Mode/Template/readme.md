The template library is the work area where we store and use templates. The use of templates can greatly enhance the efficiency of the staff needs.



### 1. Default IOS style template

​        LayaAirIDE provides by default a batch of IOS-style common UI templates, as shown in figure 1.

### 2. Create common templates and custom templates

The UI file in the ` project manager`  can be directly converted to a `common template` or a `custom template`. As shown in figure 2.

After the successful conversion, will automatically refresh the panel, such as is the first conversion function using a template, create the corresponding template directory, as shown in Figure 3. We can see in three categories : `IOS`, `commonly used templates`, `custom template`.

The directory of the template is located in the `IDE root folder \resources\app\out\vs\layaEditor\laya\template`, as shown in Figure 4.

*Tips: Created UI template is generic that can be used for other projects.*
