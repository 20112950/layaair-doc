  ​

  Improve the manual and automatic management mechanism of WeChat small program to local 4M package and 50M package

  ​	**Local 4M package management**

  ​	4M package can be passed through MiniAdpter.nativefiles=[file,dir] to set up a local file or folder, and when the path is loaded, it will be loaded from the local 4M.

  ​	**50M cache management**

  ​	By setting MiniAdpter.autoCacheFile = true to enable automatic management of 50M resources, the loaded resources are automatically cached. If the total resources are greater than 50M, files that are used infrequently are automatically deleted.

  ​	By setting MiniAdpter.autoCacheFile = false , turn on manual cache management and add the following APIs	

  ```java
  /**
  * download file
  * @param fileUrl File address (full path)
  * @param fileType file type (image、text、json、xml、arraybuffer、sound、atlas、font)
  * @param callBack File load callback, callback content[errorCode Code (0 success, 1 failure, 2 loading progress)
  * @param encoding File encoding default ascill, non-image file loading needs to set the corresponding encoding, binary encoding is an empty string
  */				
  public static function downLoadFile(fileUrl:String, fileType:String = "",callBack:Handler = null,encoding:String = "ascii"):void
  ```

  ```java
  /**
  * Get cache file list, return object based on url key
  */
  public static function getFileList():Object
  ```

  ```java
  /**
  * Get file information
  * @param fileUrl File address (full path)
  */
  public static function getFileInfo(fileUrl:String):Object
  ```

  ```java
  /**
  * Delete files locally
  * @param fileUrl File address (full path)
  * @param callBack Callback processing, used when storing pictures
  */
  public static function remove(fileUrl:String, callBack:Handler = null):void
  ```

  ```java
  /**
  * Clear cache space file content
  */		
  public static function removeAll():void
  ```

  Use 50M cache: load directly in the engine using the loader, consistent with the traditional use.
