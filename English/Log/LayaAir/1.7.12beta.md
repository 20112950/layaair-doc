# 3D

- **3D engine**
  Adding fromArray method to Vector2, Vector3 and Vector4

  transform to increase the global scale set function

  Support automatic collision management detection (SphereCollider, BoxColldier), the script class to increase the trigger series of collision detection function

  The Unity3D plug-in (1.7.0) plug-in supports SphereCollider, BoxColldier export, and can freely edit the size of the collision box in U3D. The code manually adds the collision box will no longer automatically match the Mesh size, the developer can manually put the Mesh collision box or collision ball Clone into Collider

  Supports Layer-based hierarchical collision management

  The Physics class adds collision settings between layers and Colliders

  Perfect Animator skeletal animation bounding box or bounding sphere does not update with skeleton, and bounding box can be manually edited in U3D plug-in

  The Mesh vertex color is supported when the particle emitter is in Mesh mode

  AnimationClip adds duration interface

  Fix Loader.create to load a single file, the complete function callback parameter is empty, not the resource itself BUG

  Repair normal map UV mirror, resulting in effect errors problem

  Fixed particle transparent queue sorting error BUG

  BUG clone breaking Animator component without animation

  Fix particle emitter for Mesh simulation space for world mode rotation error BUG

- **Test function**
  Add new BlinnPhongMaterial material, and the latest Unity3D plug-in (1.7.0) is also built into the material in Unity3D, keep the Unity3D and LayaAir engine in the same effect

   1）Support tilingOffset

   2）Support diffuseColor，diffuseTexture

   3）Support  specularColor、shininess、specularTexture

   4）Support  normalTexture

   5）Support custom rendering state

   Adjust the BlinnPhongMaterial material point light source and spotlight effect, manual attenuation adjusted to automatic attenuation.
