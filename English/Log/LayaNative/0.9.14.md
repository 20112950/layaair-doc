### TIPS  
This version abandoned  own "compiled JavaScriptCore" for the "system JavaScriptCore", it leads to the different supporting systems of different versions of iOS for ES6 or JS. Therefore, special attention should be paid to the compatibility of JS. It is recommended that you use the ES5 standard first. For example, iOS8's JavaScriptCore does not support Class keywords, arrow functions, and template strings
